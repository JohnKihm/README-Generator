## Description

Tired of writing READMEs? This is the app for you! README Generator poses several questions and uses your responses to quickly generate a README for your project. This spares you the time and tedium of writing a README yourself so you can get back to the good stuff, writing code.

## Usage

To use the README Generator open the command line, navigate to the directory containing the files, and enter the command 'node index.js'. Answer each prompt that appears and if you see the message 'Success!' your README has been successfully generated. Look for a new file named the title you entered followed by '-README.md'.
